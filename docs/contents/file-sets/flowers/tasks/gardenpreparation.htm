When plants are grown away from their native homes-and perhaps are accommodated in pots indoors-they may respond to quite different soils, temperatures, moisture conditions, etc., than those to which they are subjected in the wild. </span></div></div></div><ol class="ol steps"><li class="li step"><span class="ph cmd display-inline">Handle bulbs carefully.
