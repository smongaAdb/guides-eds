Garden hardy mums are perennials capable of being wintered over in the ground in most northern latitudes. Exhibition varieties are not usually as sturdy. Garden hardies are defined by their ability to produce an abundance of small blooms with little if any mechanical assistance (ie. staking) and withstanding wind and rain. Exhibition varieties on the other hand require staking, over-wintering in a relatively dry cool environment, sometimes with the addition of night lights. </span></div></div></div><div class="related-links"><div><div><span class="prefix-content">Related information</span><a class="link" href="salvia" data-attr-href="salvia.dita#salvia" data-attr-type="topic"><span class="linktext display-inline">Salvia&nbsp;V2 Date 10thJan 14:05</span></a></div></div></div></body></html>
