It is native to a large area of Europe, stretching from the Pyrenees in the west, through France and Germany to Poland in the north, Italy, Northern Greece and European Turkey. It has been introduced and is widely naturalised elsewhere. Although it is often thought of as a British native wild flower, or to have been brought to the British Isles by the Romans, it was probably introduced around the early sixteenth century.</span></div></div></div><div class="p"><div><div><span>All species of </span><b class="ph b display-inline">Galanthus</b><span> are </span><a class="xref" href="../../concepts/glossaryperennial" data-attr-keyref="perennial" data-attr-href="../../concepts/glossaryPerennial.dita" data-attr-type="glossentry">perennial</a><span>, herbaceous plants which grow from bulbs.
