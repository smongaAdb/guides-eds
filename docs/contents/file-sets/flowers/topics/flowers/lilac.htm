The leaves are opposite (occasionally in whorls of three) in arrangement, and their shape is simple and heart-shaped to broad lanceolate in most species, but pinnate in a few species (e.g. </span><b class="ph b display-inline">S. protolaciniata</b><span>, </span><b class="ph b display-inline">S. pinnatifolia</b><span>). The flowers are produced in spring, each flower being 5–10 mm in diameter with a four-lobed corolla, the corolla tube narrow, 5–20 mm long. The usual flower colour is a shade of purple (often a light purple or lilac), but white and pale pink are also found. The flowers grow in large </span><a class="xref" href="../../concepts/glossarypanicle" data-attr-keyref="panicle" data-attr-href="../../concepts/glossaryPanicle.dita" data-attr-type="glossentry">panicle</a><span>, and in several species have a strong fragrance. Flowering varies between mid spring to early summer, depending on the species.

If pruned, the plant responds by producing fast-growing young vegetative growth with no flowers, in an attempt to restore the removed branches; a pruned lilac often produces few or no flowers for one to five or more years, before the new growth matures sufficiently to start flowering. Unpruned lilacs flower reliably every year. Despite this, a common fallacy holds that lilacs should be pruned regularly. If pruning is required, it should be done right after flowering is finished, before next year's flower buds are formed. Lilacs generally grow better in slightly alkaline soil. The wood of lilac is close-grained, diffuse-porous, extremely hard and one of the densest in Europe. The sapwood is typically cream-coloured and the heartwood has various shades of brown and purple. Lilac wood has traditionally been used for engraving, musical instruments, knife handles etc. When drying, the wood has a tendency to be encurved as a twisted material, and to split into narrow sticks. </span></div></div></div><div class="related-links"><div><div><span class="prefix-content">Related information</span><a class="link" href="gardenia" data-attr-href="gardenia.dita#gardenia" data-attr-type="topic"><span class="linktext display-inline">Gardenia&nbsp;V1 Date 10thJan 14:00</span></a></div></div></div></body></html>
