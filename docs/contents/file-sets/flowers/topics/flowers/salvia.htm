The calyx is normally tubular or bell shaped, without bearded throats, and divided into two parts or lips, the upper lip entire or three-toothed, the lower two-cleft. The corollas are often claw shaped and are two-lipped with the upper lip entire or notched and spreading. The lower lip typically has three lobes with the middle lobe longest. The stamens are reduced to two short structures with anthers two-celled, the upper cell fertile, and the lower imperfect. The flower styles are two-cleft. The fruits are smooth nutlets and many species have a mucilaginous coating.

When a pollinator enters the flower for nectar, the lever activates causing the stamens to move and the pollen to be deposited on the pollinator. When the pollinator withdraws from the flower, the lever returns the stamens to their original position. As the pollinator enters another flower of the same species, the stigma is placed in a general location that corresponds to where the pollen was deposited on the pollinator's body. It is believed that this is a key factor in the speciation of this large group of diverse plants. However, it now appears that somewhat different versions of this lever mechanism have evolved in the tribe Mentheae, and that </span><b class="ph b display-inline">Salvia</b><span> is not monophyletic.</span></div></div></div><div class="related-links"><div><div><span class="prefix-content">Related information</span><a class="link" href="chrysanthemum" data-attr-href="chrysanthemum.dita#chrysanthemum" data-attr-type="topic"><span class="linktext display-inline">Chrysanthemum&nbsp;V2 Date 10thJan 14:05</span></a></div></div></div></body></html>
